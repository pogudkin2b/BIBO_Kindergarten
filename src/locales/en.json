Great menu, lots of space for games, cozy sleeping places on second floor. Closed yard with natural surface. There's a sandbox (so rare in Tbilisi). The staff's attitude to children is amazing: so much attention, care, love. It's something from childhood, something from grandma's house. My son (1 year 9 months) really wants to go there every day.",

At the time of writing the review 500 lari/month — the lowest price compared to other gardens. Has own fenced playground for walks. Daytime sleep by choice — good beds on 2nd floor. I recommend BIBO to everyone!!!",
